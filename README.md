# Number Guessing Game

## Overview
A simple Python console-based Number Guessing Game where the player aims to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

## Game Logic
1. The game randomly selects a number between `min_number` and `max_number`.
2. The player makes guesses, and the game provides hints to guess a larger or smaller number.
3. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number.

## Implementation
The game is implemented in Python using a while loop and conditional statements. The player input is validated to ensure it's a valid number.

### How to Play
1. Run the Python script.
2. Input your guess when prompted.
3. Receive hints and adjust your guess accordingly.
4. Continue guessing until you correctly identify the random number.
5. The game displays the number of attempts it took to guess correctly.
